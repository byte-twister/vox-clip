# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 21, 2026**

VoxClip does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## What VoxClip does

- Reads selected text aloud using your browser's built-in speech engine, OpenAI, or ElevenLabs
- Saves your preferences (voice, speed, pitch, provider) locally in your browser via `chrome.storage`

## API Keys

If you choose to use OpenAI or ElevenLabs, you provide your own API key. That key is stored locally in your browser and is sent directly from your browser to the respective provider. It is never sent to any VoxClip server.

## No data collection

VoxClip has no backend server. No usage data, telemetry, or personal information is collected or shared with third parties.
